# live-reload-from-scratch

This is the starting code for my article [Live Reloading From Scratch in Node.JS](https://alexander-morse.com/blog/live-reloading-from-scratch-in-nodejs/), in which we develop a simple live-reloading development server.

This main branch contains only the starting files (in the `src` directory), and isn't strictly necessary to follow along with the article. To see my own solution to the article, switch to the 'solution' branch of this repository.
